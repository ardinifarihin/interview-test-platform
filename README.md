To improve the code I made some changes:
1. Reduced the functions of AddItemA, AddItemB, AddItemC and AddItemD into 1 function called AddPriceItems
2. Made a new function called AddDiscount for A and B items.
3. Improved Scan function to check if item C is more than 6.
4. Add constants for readibility and maintainability.
5. Improved naming conventions.
